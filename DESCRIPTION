Description: A visualization suite primarily designed for single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data analysis applications but adaptable for
    other purposes as well. It contains some traditional plotting options
    (river plot, tile plot, correlation plot) optimized for ease of usage and
    flexibility, as well as some novel visualization tools. The latter include
    densityPlot, which combines a MDS representation of numeric data
    with a density plot, hullPlot, which represents a set of points together
    with their convex hull and input horizontal or verical dividing lines, and 
    radialPlot, which represents frequency data using a set of concentric 
    circles, with the center defined as the highest-frequency point.
