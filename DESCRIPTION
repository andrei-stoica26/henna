Description: A visualization suite primarily designed for single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data analysis applications but adaptable for
    other purposes as well. It optimizes some traditional plotting options
    (e.g., correlation, density and alluvial plots) for ease of usage and 
    flexibility, and introduces some novel plots. The latter 
    include hullPlot, which represents a set of points together
    with their convex hull and input dividing lines, and radialPlot, which 
    represents discrete numeric data using a set of concentric 
    circles, with the center defined as the highest-value point.
