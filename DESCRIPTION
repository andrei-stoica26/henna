Description: A visualization suite primarily designed for single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data analysis applications but well-suited for
    other purposes as well. It introduces novel plots to represent two-variable
    and frequency data and optimizes some commonly used plotting options
    (e.g., correlation, network, density, alluvial and volcano plots) 
    for ease of usage and flexibility.
